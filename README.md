# Project Overview
This project comprises four tasks, focusing on different aspects of machine learning and data analysis. The tasks include clustering, classification, data aggregation, and building a simple web application using Streamlit to represent the results.

# Tasks
Task 1: Machine Learning - Clustering
Objective: Use a clustering technique to extract patterns or segregate data into groups.

User Story: Users should be able to provide a data point (a row) and the program should identify the cluster to which the given data point belongs and explain why.

Hint: Use any clustering algorithm such as K-means

Task 2: Machine Learning - Classification
Objective: Train classification model(s) on the training dataset and test the algorithm on the test dataset. Share the predicted target values for evaluation.

Train multiple classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, SVM).

Share the target values for each algorithm.

Provide the training accuracy and explain the choice of algorithms.

Task 3: Python Data Aggregation
Objective: Use the provided raw data to derive specific metrics.

Calculate the total duration for each "inside" and "outside" activity on a date-wise basis.

Calculate the date-wise number of "picking" and "placing" activities.

Sample output is provided in the output sheet.

Task 4: Basic Streamlit
Task: Represent output of above 3 tasks either in streamlit.
