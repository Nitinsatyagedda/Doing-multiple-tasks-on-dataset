# Doing-multiple-tasks-on-dataset (Clustering, Classification models and presenting them on streamlit)
This is an open-source project repo which deals with multiple tasks.

Task 1: Machine Learning - Clustering
Task: Use any clustering technique to extract patterns or segregate data into groups.
User Story: User should be able to provide a data point (a row) and program should be able to identify
to which cluster given data point belongs to and why?

Task 2: Machine Learning - Classification
Task: Train any classification model(s) on the train sheet and test your algorithm on the test sheet.
Share target values for the test. Using multiple algorithms, plz share target values and accuracy for each algorithm.

Task 3: Python
Task: Use rawdata as input and derive
1. Datewise total duration for each inside and outside.
2. Datewise number of picking and placing activity done.
Sample output shared in output sheet.

Task 4: Basic Streamlit/Flask
Task: Represent output of above 3 tasks either in streamlit or flask page
